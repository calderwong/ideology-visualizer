# Ideology Graph Visualizer

## What & Why

This project aims to create a web-based, interactive visualization tool for exploring ideological spectrums and the relationships between different viewpoints. In a world of complex political, social, and philosophical ideas, visualizing these concepts can aid understanding, facilitate discussion, and support research.

The goal is to move beyond simple left-right lines and represent ideological landscapes in a more nuanced way, potentially using graph structures or multi-dimensional plots.

## Use Cases

*   **Education:** A visual aid for students in political science, sociology, philosophy, etc., to grasp the connections and distinctions between ideologies.
*   **Research:** A tool for researchers to plot and analyze data related to ideological positioning derived from surveys, text analysis, or other sources.
*   **Journalism & Analysis:** An illustrative graphic for articles or reports discussing political landscapes or ideological trends.
*   **Public Discourse:** A shared visual framework to help structure and clarify discussions about different belief systems.
*   **Personal Learning:** A way for individuals to explore and understand the diversity of ideological thought.

## Current Features (MVP v1)

*   Static display of a predefined ideological map using HTML and potentially a JavaScript library (like D3.js).
*   Nodes representing specific ideologies or key figures/concepts.
*   Basic web rendering.

## Potential Future Features

*   **Interactivity:** Hovering over nodes for tooltips, clicking for detailed information panels (definitions, key proponents, related concepts, sources).
*   **Data Customization:** Ability to load different datasets defining ideologies and their relationships (e.g., via JSON).
*   **Layout Algorithms:** Options for different visual layouts (e.g., force-directed graphs, clustered layouts, predefined spatial arrangements).
*   **Search & Filtering:** Functionality to search for specific ideologies or filter the view based on categories.
*   **User Input:** Allow users to (privately) place themselves on the map or compare different viewpoints.
*   **Multiple Dimensions:** Representing ideology across more than just one or two axes.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/calderwong/ideology-visualizer.git`
2.  Navigate to the directory: `cd ideology-visualizer`
3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

    *Note: For features involving data loading (future), running a simple local web server might be necessary due to browser security restrictions (CORS).* `python -m http.server` or similar.

## Usage

Currently, simply open `index.html` to view the static visualization.

[Usage instructions will be updated as interactive features are added]
